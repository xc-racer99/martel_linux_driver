This driver supports the MPP5510 series, MPP5610 series, MCP7810, MCP7830, MCP8810, and MCP8830 thermal printers made by Martel.

I've reposted it here as the official download from the Martel site (http://www.martelinstruments.com/) requires logging in, plus the downloaded files are in a weird-semi corrupted tar.  It also needed a minor modification to the build flags to build properly (only tested on Ubuntu 16.04)

The code is licensed under the GPL.

To Build:

Make sure you have (on Debian-based distrubtions) the following packages installed: build-essential libcups-dev libcupsimage2-dev

cd src
make
sudo make install

Adding the printer:

For serial port:
lpadmin -p {Printer Name} -E -v martel:{/dev/node}?type=serial+baudrate={1200|2400|4800|9600|19200}+handshake={none|rtscts|xonxoff}

For parallel port:
lpadmin -p {Printer Name} -E -v martel:{/dev/node}?type=parallel+poll={poll|irq}

Make sure that you have permissions setup correctly for /dev/node and that the options are correct for what your printer is set to.
